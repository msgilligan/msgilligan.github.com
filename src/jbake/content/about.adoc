Clearly, I really hate working on personal websites. Maybe http://jbake.org[JBake] + http://asciidoctor.org[AsciiDoctor] + https://gradle.org[Gradle] will change that.

You can find further evidence of this at the following locations:

* http://code.msgilligan.com[code.msgilligan.com] (my neglected blog)
* http://www.msgilligan.com[www.msgilligan.com] (my aging home page)

I do like working on Open Source projects, however:

* http://github.com/msgilligan/[GitHub projects]
* https://code.google.com/u/115789962356478683683/[Google Code Profile]

The source for this blog is in the `source` branch of the https://github.com/msgilligan/msgilligan.github.io/tree/source[msgilligan/msgilligan.github.io] repository.
